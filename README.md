# nf-discord-bot
A discord bot used to joke around with friends, made by your lovely.

## Usage
Use @NFBot to get the prefix for the commands(default prefix = '?').
```
?copycat - makes the bot take over your identity and use your discord profile picture.
?say [text] - makes the bot say whatever text you input, and also to remove your command message.
?profilepic [name] - gets a user's profile picture and posts it in an embed.
?prefix [up to 3 characters here] - sets the bot's command prefix, default is "?".
```

More will come soonTM.
